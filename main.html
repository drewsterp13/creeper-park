        <p class="col-10 col-md-8 col-lg-6 bg-light">Greetings adventurer, welcome to Creeper's Impact National Park in Aureum, Coloado, where magical adventures come true. 
        It is home to Lapis Lake, home to the red and green pufferfish known as the Cheep-Cheep ("Tetraodontidae-Ludus"), their range is only in this lake and
        they are very unique, resembling the enemy pufferfish from Super Mario, but unlike most pufferfish species, and the game entites,
        they are friendly towards humans. We also have hiking trails that has diverse lanscape from  icy Mount Solo to arid Blocksborough Park to moist 
        tropical Cozumel Waterfalls despite the latitudinal odds  against the park. It is not just the natural landscape that brings intrigue 
        to us, we also have the historical Redstone Fort, which has redstone mechanics inside of the fort that makes it possible to shoot arrows 
        and TNT to large distances. If you are more in the mood for playing sports in the Main Arena, we have a swimming pool, a basketball court, and a baseball field. 
        If you want to party with family and friends, we offer places to rent also in the Main Arena to have large gatherings. Speaking of renting, we also have small cabins 
        that you can rent that have seneic views from its own living room! So check out the park, 
        more info is under the link to <a class="text-primary fw-bold p-0" href="info.html">INFO.</a></li></p>
        <h3>What's New</h3>
        <p class="col-10 col-md-8 col-lg-6 bg-warning">The new children's playground in the Main Arena is now OPEN! And, we are planning to have the 
        100th anniversary of the park, with a festival with food, and limited time deals.
